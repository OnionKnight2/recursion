# recursion
Practice recursion with 2 assignments

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Assignment 1

### Iterative Fibonacci method
Using iteration, write a method #fibs which takes a number
and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. 
Using an example input of 8, 
this method should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]

### Recursive Fibonacci method
Write another method #fibs_rec which solves the same problem recursively.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Assingment 2

Build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array,
using a recursive merge sort methodology.
